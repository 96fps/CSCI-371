# CSCI-371
Computer Graphics coursework.
The course is built around the well received 
but dated "OpenGL: A Primer" by Edwartd Angel,
but I plan on adding WebGL and mobile/GLES code.

## Dependancies
Currently these programs are written only targetting linux systems.
You'll need libxmu-dev libxmu-headers, usually this can be installed with:

`sudo apt intstall libxmu-dev libxmu-headers`

## Building
In a terminal, cd to the directory of example.c and the makefile

run `make example`
this should create or update the executable.
